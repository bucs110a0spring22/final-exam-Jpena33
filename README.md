Summary of Program: 

The program runs a weather application that gives various weather conditions based on a location the user inputs. It uses the classes of weather.py and location.py to give the user the weather and coordinates of a given location.  

Most Challenging topic in the course: 

In my opinion the most challenging topic in the course were graphic user interfaces. To me, they were an abstract topic that delved into pygame (a fresh topic) and have to manage to work well in the overall program.  

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
Was not able to print location or weather onto console. Was not able to get user to input any random location and retrieve exact coordinates or weather at those coordinates.
